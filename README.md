# Welcome to Hacktoberfest 2023 event

* Hacktoberfest is DigitalOceanâ€™s annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October. It is all about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things open source, especially the people that make open source so special.
